Cricket score board

[x] github repo

[x] project requirements
    
  [x] take some sample/idea from internet
        
        - match fixture - add teams (A, B), players etc
        
        - team A Bats first and score boards shows the score
        
        - simple score board that shows current score
          
          - teams who are playing against each other
          
          - runs/wickets (current over/total overs)
- decide way to program/work
    - follow BDD
        - feature: store runs for team
            - scenerio: as current team scores runs they must be stored
              given: team A is playing, when player 1 scores 2 runs then 2 runs should be added to current score of Team A
                                        and to the score of player 1 as well.
    - follow TDD
